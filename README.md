    If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players.
    Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist),
     a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:
</h1>
<h1>Rock smashes scissors.</h1>
<h1>Paper covers rock.</h1>
<h1>Scissors cut paper.</h1>

Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code.
